# Simple Mechanics in Phaser.js

This is an example game where I show simple ways to implement mechanics in a game using the framework [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/).

In this repository, you can see:

- Functions to implement platform and Point & Click mechanics;
- A function to create animations using just one row;
- How to implement a camera to follow your character;
- A loading screen.

I didn't upload the assets folder because it contains some assets that I used in the game ["Conquistado"](https://catfelps.itch.io/conquistado), but if you want to see a practical example with the assets, you can watch my video [clicking here!]().
